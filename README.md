# DTS-based-coil-measurement-technique
This repository stores files that are part of a novel method for profiling temperature at a spatial resolution of several millimeters. The aim is to make high resolution temperature profiling more accessible and reproducible for researchers looking to gather data using DTS. The repository contains several files:

- An elaborate manual which guides the coil generation, manufacturing and deployment processes.
- The grasshopper script to generate the laser cutting files
