# DTS-based-coil-measurement-technique
This repository hosts files that are part of a novel method for profiling (air) temperature at the millimeter scale, on the basis of Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS). The aim is to make high resolution temperature profiling more accessible and reproducible for researchers looking to gather data using DTS. The repository contains the following items:

- An elaborate manual which guides the coil generation, manufacturing and deployment processes, digitally available [here](https://www.instructables.com/DTS-based-Coil-High-resolution-Temperature-Profile/).
- The grasshopper script to generate the laser cutting files.
